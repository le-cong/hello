1.	We’d like to understand more on the astigmatism ‘compensating’. Is it because that the new brand doesn’t support astigmatism or it’s because the compensation will work better for Kevin’s eye?
2.	We understand that you are trying to improve the distance sight for Kevin so that he will see clearer. Actually for most of the time (especially in summer), Kevin use eyes in short distance much more than long distance. Should we worry about that it will make it worse to increase the prescription?
3.	In the future, once Kevin’s vision gets stable and starts using regular contact lenses, will there be still prescription with astigmatism? If it will be with astigmatism, then will the ‘compensation’ part be reverted back in that case? In another word, suppose what we have today worked out permanently, will Kevin eventually have prescription for the regular contact lenses with :
a.	8.0 with astigmatism;
b.	8.5 without astigmatism;
c.	8.5 with astigmatism.
